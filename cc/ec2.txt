‚úÖ What to Cover in Case Study: Amazon EC2
üìå What is Amazon EC2?
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It allows you to run virtual servers (called instances) for your applications.

üîπ Key Features of EC2
On-demand compute capacity

Various instance types (General purpose, Compute optimized, Memory optimized, etc.)

Ability to choose OS (Linux, Windows, etc.)

Integration with EBS (storage), VPC (networking), IAM (permissions), etc.

Auto-scaling and Load Balancing

‚úÖ Practical Steps to Launch an EC2 Instance (Free Tier)
Create AWS Account

Go to https://aws.amazon.com

Sign up and verify credit/debit card

Log in to AWS Management Console

Open EC2 Dashboard

Search EC2 in the services search bar

Click on Launch Instance

Configure Instance

Name: MyEC2Instance

Choose Amazon Machine Image (AMI): Amazon Linux 2 (free tier eligible)

Choose Instance Type: t2.micro (free tier)

Key Pair: Create new key pair (download .pem file)

Network Settings: Default VPC and auto-assign public IP

Storage: Default 8 GB

Click Launch Instance

Access Instance using SSH (from Linux/Ubuntu Terminal)

bash
Copy code
chmod 400 your-key.pem
ssh -i "your-key.pem" ec2-user@<your-public-ip>
üåê EC2 Use Case Example
Use Case: Hosting a static website
Steps:

Install web server (Apache/Nginx) in your EC2

Upload HTML files via SCP or copy-paste

Open port 80 in the security group

Access via browser using public IP
