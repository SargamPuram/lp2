Creating an application in Salesforce.com using Apex Programming Language involves building a custom application on the Salesforce platform. Apex is a strongly typed, object-oriented programming language that runs on the Salesforce platform and allows you to interact with Salesforce data and logic.

Here’s an overview and the steps to create a basic application using Apex:

Steps to Create an Application in Salesforce Using Apex:
1. Set Up Your Salesforce Developer Account
Go to Salesforce Developer and sign up for a free developer account.

Once registered, log in to your Salesforce Developer Edition.

2. Create a New Application in Salesforce
Go to Setup:

In your Salesforce dashboard, click the Gear icon (top-right corner) and select Setup.

Create New App:

In the Quick Find box, type App Manager.

Click on App Manager, then click New Lightning App.

Follow the wizard to define your app's name, logo, and navigation settings. Choose Standard App for a simple layout.

3. Create a Custom Object (Optional but Recommended)
In Setup, search for Objects in the Quick Find box.

Under Objects and Fields, click Object Manager.

Click Create, then Custom Object.

Fill in the necessary details like the Object Name, Label, and Plural Label. This object will store the data for your application.

4. Write Apex Code
Apex code is used for backend logic in Salesforce. It can be used for triggers, classes, and web services.

Example of a Simple Apex Class:

Navigate to Apex Classes:

In Setup, search for Apex Classes in the Quick Find box.

Click Apex Classes then click New.

Write Apex Class Code:

Here is a simple example of an Apex class:

apex
Copy code
public class AccountHandler {

    // Method to insert an Account
    public void createAccount(String accountName) {
        Account newAccount = new Account(Name=accountName);
        insert newAccount;
    }

    // Method to update an Account's name
    public void updateAccountName(Id accountId, String newName) {
        Account accToUpdate = [SELECT Id, Name FROM Account WHERE Id = :accountId LIMIT 1];
        accToUpdate.Name = newName;
        update accToUpdate;
    }

    // Method to get all Accounts
    public List<Account> getAllAccounts() {
        return [SELECT Id, Name FROM Account];
    }
}
Explanation:

The class AccountHandler has three methods:

createAccount: Creates a new Account record.

updateAccountName: Updates an Account record's name based on the provided accountId.

getAllAccounts: Retrieves a list of all Account records.

5. Create Apex Triggers (Optional)
Apex Triggers are used to automate actions based on changes to Salesforce data (e.g., create, update, delete).

Example of an Apex Trigger:

apex
Copy code
trigger AccountTrigger on Account (before insert, before update) {
    for (Account acc : Trigger.new) {
        // Example: Automatically set the Account's Name to uppercase before insert or update
        acc.Name = acc.Name.toUpperCase();
    }
}
This trigger runs before an Account is inserted or updated, and it modifies the Name field by converting it to uppercase.

6. Create Visualforce Page (Optional)
Visualforce is a framework that allows you to build custom UIs in Salesforce.

Example of a Visualforce Page:

Navigate to Visualforce Pages:

In Setup, search for Visualforce Pages.

Click New to create a new page.

Write the Visualforce Markup:

html
Copy code
<apex:page controller="AccountHandler">
    <apex:form>
        <apex:pageBlock title="Create New Account">
            <apex:pageBlockSection>
                <apex:inputText label="Account Name" value="{!accountName}" />
            </apex:pageBlockSection>
            <apex:pageBlockSection>
                <apex:commandButton value="Create Account" action="{!createAccount}" />
            </apex:pageBlockSection>
        </apex:pageBlock>
    </apex:form>
</apex:page>
Explanation:

The Visualforce page is tied to the AccountHandler Apex controller.

Users can input the account name, and upon submitting, the createAccount method from the Apex controller is triggered to create a new Account record.

7. Deploy Your Application
Once you’ve created your Apex code, triggers, and Visualforce pages, you can deploy them to production via Salesforce’s Deployment tools or Change Sets.

Commands & Tools You Will Use:
Salesforce Developer Console: For running tests, debugging, and executing Apex code.

Salesforce CLI (Command-Line Interface): For interacting with Salesforce directly from your terminal, allowing you to push and pull code.

To install Salesforce CLI on Ubuntu:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get install sfdx
On Windows, download the CLI installer from the Salesforce Developer Website.

8. Testing the Application
Use the Apex Test Execution feature from Salesforce Setup to run unit tests for your Apex code.

Ensure that your triggers, classes, and Visualforce pages work as expected by running tests directly in the Developer Console or Salesforce CLI.

Viva Questions You Might Be Asked:
What is Apex?

Apex is a strongly-typed, object-oriented programming language that is used to perform custom business logic on the Salesforce platform.

Explain the difference between Apex Class and Apex Trigger.

Apex Class: Contains reusable methods for custom business logic.

Apex Trigger: Runs automatically when a specific event (insert, update, delete) occurs on a Salesforce object.

What is a Visualforce Page?

Visualforce is a framework that allows developers to create custom user interfaces in Salesforce.

What is the purpose of trigger.new in an Apex Trigger?

trigger.new contains the new values of the records being inserted or updated.

Explain Governor Limits in Salesforce.

Salesforce enforces strict limits on the number of database queries, DML operations, and other system resources a single transaction can use to ensure shared resources are not overwhelmed.

How does Salesforce handle asynchronous operations?

Salesforce provides asynchronous processing using tools like Queueable Apex, Batch Apex, and Future Methods.

What is the role of Salesforce CLI in Apex Development?

Salesforce CLI allows developers to interact with Salesforce directly from the command line, enabling code deployment, testing, and more.

What are the benefits of using Apex over declarative tools in Salesforce?

Apex allows for complex business logic, integrations with external systems, and custom automation that cannot be achieved purely using declarative tools.












Steps to Create an Application in Salesforce using Apex Programming Language (Simplified)
1. Set Up Your Salesforce Developer Account (If Not Already Done)
Visit Salesforce Developer and sign up for a free account.

Once done, log in to the Salesforce Developer Edition.

2. Create a Custom Application in Salesforce
Go to Setup:

From the Salesforce dashboard, click on the Gear icon (top-right corner) and select Setup.

Create a New App:

In the Quick Find search bar, type App Manager.

Click on App Manager and then click on New Lightning App.

Follow the steps to define the app name, logo, and basic settings.

Add Objects to the App:

In the Object Manager, you can create new custom objects. These will hold your data.

3. Write Your Apex Code
Apex is the programming language in Salesforce used for business logic. You’ll be mainly working with Apex Classes and Apex Triggers.

Apex Class Example:
In Setup, search for Apex Classes.

Click New to create a new class.

Simple Apex Class to Insert Account Data:

apex
Copy code
public class SimpleAccountCreation {

    // Method to create Account
    public void createAccount(String accountName) {
        Account newAccount = new Account(Name = accountName);
        insert newAccount;
    }
}
Explanation:

This class has a method createAccount, which takes an account name as input, creates a new Account object, and inserts it into the database.

Apex Trigger Example:
In Setup, search for Apex Triggers.

Click New to create a new trigger.

Trigger to Automatically Convert Account Name to Uppercase:

apex
Copy code
trigger AccountNameTrigger on Account (before insert, before update) {
    for (Account acc : Trigger.new) {
        acc.Name = acc.Name.toUpperCase();
    }
}
Explanation:

This trigger fires before an account is inserted or updated. It converts the Name field to uppercase.

4. Test Your Apex Code
You can run tests in the Developer Console in Salesforce.

Go to Setup, search for Apex Test Execution, and click Run Test.

In the Developer Console, you can write test methods to test the functionality of your Apex classes and triggers.

5. Deploy Your Code
After testing, you can deploy your Apex classes and triggers to production using Change Sets or Salesforce Deployment Tools.
